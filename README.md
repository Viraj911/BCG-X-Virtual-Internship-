# PowerCo Customer Churn Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the analysis of customer churn for PowerCo, a major gas and electricity utility. The project was completed during my virtual internship with BCG Gamma through Forage.

## Project Structure

### Task 1: Understanding the Business Context
- **Objective**: Identify the necessary client data for analysis and outline the techniques for investigating PowerCo's customer churn issue.
- **Outcome**: An email summarizing the approach to the Associate Director.

### Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Objective**: Investigate if price sensitivity is the leading factor for customer churn.
- **Techniques Used**: Python for data analysis and visualization to interpret key trends.

### Task 3: Feature Engineering
- **Objective**: Test hypotheses using feature engineering to analyze PowerCo's data.
- **Outcome**: Development of a new feature for the analysis using Python.

### Task 4 & 5: Predictive Modelling and Communication
- **Objective**: Use predictive modelling to indicate churn risk and effectively communicate insights.
- **Techniques Used**: Random forest technique for building a predictive churn model and writing an executive summary of the findings.

## Key Findings
- The churn rate in the SME division is high at 9.7% across 14,606 customers.
- The predictive model indicates that yearly consumption, forecasted consumption, and net margin are the primary drivers of churn, rather than customer price sensitivity.
- A targeted discount strategy of 20% is effective for high-value customers with a high probability of churning.

## Usage
The code and analysis are provided as Jupyter notebooks. To replicate the findings, ensure you have the required Python libraries installed and run the notebooks in sequence.
